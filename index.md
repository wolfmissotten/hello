# hello

This is a dummy package named hello, that momentarily only includes the
function
[`hello()`](https://wolfmissotten.github.io/Repo_package_hello/reference/hello.md).
To get started, see [Get
started](https://wolfmissotten.github.io/Repo_package_hello/articles/hello.html),
which is a vignette.
